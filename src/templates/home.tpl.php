                <h3>LIFE IS BEATIFUL</h3><br><br>
                <p>Daily gratitude is the key to happiness and loving yourself.ç
                Start a gratitude journal, an Instagram channel, a blog, or just take 
                three minutes every day to think about all the things you have to be 
                thankful for, such as your health, your life, your friends, your country, 
                M&Ms, how long that old pan has lasted you, or how the person on the bus 
                let you off first.
                <br><br>
                When we get comfortable, we get ungrateful. Change that, and show 
                gratitude every day. According to Harvard Health, gratitude can make 
                you feel more positive emotions and research has shown it can improve 
                your overall wellbeing.
                <br><br>
                The only things you can control are the ones you can change, including your reactions. 
                Recognize that, like the weather, you do not influence other people, their decisions, 
                or their actions.
                <br><br>
                Instead of attempting to control everything in life, focus on how you respond to it. 
                Do the best you can and then put your hands up and say, “it is in the hands of the Gods now,
                ” letting everything work itself out rather than attempting to control everyone and everything. 
                Everything finally resolves itself.
